					<h3>Guy Emmons, Founder</h3>
					<p>
                        My name is Guy Emmons and I own and operate Old Glory Skidsteer Services Inc.  Being a relatively small operation Old Glory Skidsteer Services primarily focuses on residential property and landscape issues. I have been in the grading and landscape business since 2003 with my older brother T.J. Emmons until his passing (end of '04) to date.  After volunteering in relief after Superstorm Sandy aiding in the clean up and property recovery I had a renewed spirit with a heavy heart for those who suffer devastation.  God has provided me opportunity and ability to help. It seems that here is an abundance of work to be completed.  Although I have and continue to enjoy volunteering my services I am still a licensed  contractor, and a registered and fully insured corporation doing business in New Jersey complete with all the associated costs. </p>

                        <p>Although I am a for profit company, it is my purpose to  give you the best solution with minimal cost. I am a professional who loves his work. I get to serve God and while providing for my family.  I actually prefer working with homeowners in fulfilling or recapturing their landscape dreams. I will  add a more personal touch, a friendship. With 10 Years experience, I have completed many jobs with a large percentage repeat customers. I have developed many personal friendships in the process.
                        </p>

                        <p>Although I have completed jobs throughout the state of New Jersey, my current area of focus is the Ocean,  Monmouth,  Mercer, and Burlington County areas.

                    <h3> How "Old Glory" became our name.</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our father Nelson Emmons  was a WWII veteran and a true patriot of this great country.  Growing up in the 60s and 70s, my three brothers and I were exposed to many incidents whereby he would voice his opinion or take action on anything un-American  One of  his convictions was that the American flag was to be treated with the utmost respect and honor. On several occasions he would remove a flag that was not illuminated properly at a local mall. He would subsequently return the flag to the owner with the admonition to illuminate it or take it down at night.  The owner refused to do either. That did not bode well with Nelson  and  It came to a point after a few more incidents that complaints were signed against him. That did not deter him in the least.  With the full support of the Federal government  Nelson eventually prevailed to the point where the owner took the flag pole down. </p>

                        <p>This had a profound effect that  fueled all four of us to help develop  our own  sense of patriotism . Our oldest  brother Timmy  (affectionately known as TJ) served his country in Vietnam and picked up where Nelson left off. Since then until his passing in 2005  TJ named and/or included ‚ÄùOld Glory" into every business venture that he got involved with. The flag was his symbol insomuch that he was buried in American flag pants. In 2003 TJ and I started the grading and site work business as Old Glory Associates.</p>


                        <p> The name wasn't chosen for its clever branding or colorful scheme. It was more of an identity and sense of pride.  In 2012  out of respect and honor for Nelson and TJ, I continued with "Old Glory" naming the business Old Glory Skidsteer Services.
                    </p>
